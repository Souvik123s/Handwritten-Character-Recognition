# Proposed Methodology
- Separate the foreground and the background pixels
- Reshape the Images to the 28×28 pixel frame.
- Randomly Select the train and test data images for the model
- Applying the Primary Component analysis(PCA)
- Applying the Multi Layer Perceptron(MLP)
# Testing
## Run the model for –
- 50% train and 50% test data
- 60% train and 40% test data
- 70% train and 30% test data
- 80% train and 20% test data
## Run the model for 20 times for each case

# Result

# Scope for Improvement
- If the skew correction can be done in the pre processing step
